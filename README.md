# An Exploration of the Art of Sarah Holland: YouTuber, Writer, Actor

That's the name of this project for the good ole resume. More technically, this is a (possibly) static site I am building from the ground up using HTML, CSS, (probably) JS, and the lovely hosting power of GitHub pages.

I created this project because my girlfriend and I are celebrating 1 year this August, so I had a deadline to at least get something up and running. 

Also, because if you know me, you know I bring up Sarah often, since she is often a player in my most memorable stories.

I hope to accomplish a few goals with this project:

1. Apply my knowledge of HTML and CSS.
2. Flex my design muscles and synthesize technology and aesthetics. 
3. Make something lovely for someone lovelier. 

I hope you enjoy your stay here. :heart:
